Hello, 
the scripts in this repository allow you to reproduce all figures and tables presented in our manuscript: 
"Is education a risk factor for Parkinsonâ€™s disease?: A systematic review and meta-analysis"

You may also modify the scripts to explore the data as you may wish. 

It is important that you run meta_analysis.R before yy because tables.Rmd uses the results of meta_analysis.R.
For this to be possible, you must supply both scripts with the same working directory where files can be saved and from they can be loaded again. 
Please do so at the top of each script.

For the scripts to run you must ensure that all required packages are installed. Uncomment the line of code installing the required packages if necessary.

Have fun reproducing and exploring the data!

Please feel free to reach out to lammer@cbs.mpg.de if you have any troubles or questions.
